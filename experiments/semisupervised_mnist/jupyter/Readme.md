This folder contains the jupyter notebook to process the model fits. 

`examing_tuning.ipynb` loads the results from running the scripts in `../tuning_scripts/` and plots the optimization path for each of our methods, for various hyperparameters. 

`ss_mnist_results.ipynb` loads a fitted model and examines the reconstructions. 

`elbo_plots.ipynb` loads the results from running the scripts in `../scripts`, which fit the model and save the optimization path. This notebook 
compares the optimization path across various methods.
